Problem Statement:Online Integrated Platform for Student Projects

Description: The project involves creating an online platform to integrate and manage student projects from various universities and colleges. Students can submit their project details, collaborate with peers, and showcase their work to potential employers and academic institutions. This platform would also serve as a central repository where students can document their progress, receive feedback from mentors, and access resources that could help them complete their projects. It may also include tools for project management, task tracking, and forums for discussion and knowledge sharing.
